# How to editing records with errors

The lists of records with errors and quadarats with errors are [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBImortality/tree/main/testthat/reports/requires_field_fix).

1. Open the FFF's account and choose 'Legacy Portal'
2. Go to 'Submissions' and in the 'Filters' section on the right select 'SCBI Mortality'
3. Add a filter - this can be the quadrat name from the drop down list: Quad/lookuplistpicker_1
4. Apply the filter and you should have a list of the submissions for the quadrat (likely only 1)
5. To the left of the submission there is a 'View' button with an arrow. Click on the arrow and 'Dispatch'
6. Type ecoclimlab@gmail.com in the 'Users' box, then click 'Dispatch'
7. Open the FFF's app on the iPad and open the Inbox to view the dispatched file. From there you can edit and resubmit and the submission should replace the original.
