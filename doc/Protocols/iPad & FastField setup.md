# iPad & FastField Setup

## iPads
We have two iPads in the lab. Passcodes should be written on them; if not, ask Krista.

### apps
iPads should be set up with the folllowing apps (see below for details on each):

- FastField (for data collection)
- Dropbox (for sharing/ syncing files in GitHub repo)
- mail app (for accessing lab gmail account)
- an app to measure tree tilt angle (there are various apps that work; I have iLevel on my iPhone)

## FastField
Starting 2021, we will use the FastField system/ app for data entry. 

### FastField Account
URL: https://manage.fastfieldforms.com/Account/Login

**Lab account** (to be used by all):

username: ecoclimlab@gmail.com 

password: (request from Krista)

### App
Fastfield app should be installed on lab iPads (but check).
You can also install on your personal phone or tablet if you have any reason to want that.

There's also a web app, so no need to put app on your personal device for practice.

## Dropbox
Dropbox is used to sync all the files in this repo to the iPads. 
Relevant documents include protocols, maps, and error reports.
