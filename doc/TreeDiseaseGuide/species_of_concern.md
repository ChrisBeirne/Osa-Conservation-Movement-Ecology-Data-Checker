# SCBI species of concern based on mortality census
The following list categorizes SCBI tree species based on their mortality rates. *This is an initial categorization based on tree mortality only, to be modified as we bring in more information.*

## High concern
### Criteria
- mortality rate (`estimate`) ≥ 5 % yr-1 in more than one year
- dominant species (≥100 individuals of DBH ≥10 cm) with an overall increasing trend and ≥ 5 % yr-1 in the most recent year (2021)

### Species


## Moderate concern

### Criteria
- mortality rate (`estimate`) ≥ 5 % yr-1 in only one year (but does not meet criteria of dominant species with increasing trend)
### Species

## Low concern
### Criteria
- mortality rate (`estimate`) always < 5 % yr-1
